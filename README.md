## Goal

Provide a clearly defined goal for the project and what this repository contains. Outline what the final deliverable is and how it can be accessed.

## Background  

Provide detailed background information about the project. Readers should be able to have a clear understanding of the goals and methods used. This section should also give the reader instructions on how to navigate the repository. 

## Data

Mention what data is being used for the project and where it is stored. Mention any data privacy concerns. 

## Models

Mention what models are being used or developed as part of the project. Provide information on how to use these models (link to HuggingFace etc.)

## Timeline

Outline an estimated timeline for the project. 

## Repo Structure 

Provide details on how readers can use the repository to replicate your results, run any final deliverables like apps or inference models that you may have trained/fine-tuned. Ensure that the repository is well structued and folders are named appropriately. Follow best practices (Notebook naming convention {00s for templates, 10s for data loading and prep, 20s for exploratory analysis, 30s for feature engineering, 40s for model development/training, 50s for evaluation and inference})
